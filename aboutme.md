<h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>

I graduated from the University of Vermont in 2020, where I received a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.  I like to work all across the stack, but I lean towards back-end development.  I enjoy working and learning with others and hopefully building software that has a positive impact. I currently work with SportsDataIO, building systems that power commercial APIs as well internal tools used by the data operations department.

My other areas of interest include education and public transportation. Outside of technology, I also enjoy biking, cooking, and sports.  I am also trilingual in English, Spanish, and Bengali.
