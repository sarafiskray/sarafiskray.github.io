<br>

#### I designed and developed an NBA Player Comparison Tool, used to compare recent player performances.  This project was built using React and Recharts, with live data coming from API-NBA by api-sports.  It is designed for use on a computer or a tablet, however it functions on screens of all sizes.

<br>

#### Funded by the Vermont Agency of Transportation, I worked in a small team of University of Vermont students and professors to develop a complete RFID Traffic Sign Management System.  Traffic signage inventory management is an important, though often overlooked, part of transportation asset management.  I was in charge of development of the mobile reader.

[<img src="images/flaskpymongo.jpg?raw=true"  />](/recipe)

#### The Millennial Recipe System was one of the first full-stack applications that I worked on.  It was built with MongoDB, a Flask API hosted on AWS, and a React front-end.  My focus for this project was on the back-end.  This project was built for a software engineering course.

</p>

#### The Landlord Watchlist is a project created by the Office of the Public Advocate that exposes the worst landlords in NYC.  During my time at the office, I contributed to various aspects of the Landlord Watchlist.  I did data cleaning and data modeling using Python as well as developed a RESTful API using Flask.  I also wrote SQL queries to optimize the search engine and began the creation of a new search engine.

## [Raspberry Pi Car Music Player](/rpi)

<p align="center">
<a href="https://sarafiskray.github.io/rpi">
<img src="images/prius.jpg?raw=true" height="220"/></a>
</p>

#### I built this project for a computer organization course, for which the final project required use of a Raspberry Pi.  I created a car music player because I felt it would be both fun and functional.  It is easy to lose cell signal in Vermont, and this project is designed to work offline.  In addition, it was also an aesthetic upgrade to an old car.  This project was built using Python and the Kivy library.

#### This project is a simple static website for a fake Italian restaurant.  This was the final project for a web design course, taught in only HTML and CSS.  It was built over a short period of time in order to demonstrate our proficiency in CSS.

## [C++ Abstract Art](/artgame)

[<img src="images/brush.jpg?raw=true"/>](/artgame)

#### This was an early university project, built for a C++ course.  The app started with a very simple idea, the ability to jump around the screen and paint.  This simple idea was not as simple to implement.  You can download and try for yourself!
